# Jot

An online, minimal note-taking app built with a Rails API and Javascript that allows users to take notes and share them with each other live.
**LIVE DEMO:** https://tiffnuugen.github.io/jot-app/js-frontend/ (Please refresh page multiple times for test note to appear!)

## Installation

To install Jot, first clone the repo to the location you want it to be in like so:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tiffnuugen/jot-app.git
```

Then, cd into the 'rails-api' folder.

Run the bundle command to install the gems for this project:

```bash
bundle install
```
## Usage
To display the frontend, cd into the 'js-frontend' folder and open it in your text editor.  

Then, copy and paste the full file path of index.html into the browser.

Cd into the 'rails-api' folder to start the rails server and refresh the page to get everything working:
