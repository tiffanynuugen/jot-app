# Jot

Jot is an online, minimal note-taking app. It is a fun and sandbox-y way to take notes online. It essentially works like online text editors but with notes instead.

## Installation

To install Jot, first clone the repo to the location you want it to be in:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tiffnuugen/jot-app.git
```

Then, cd into the 'rails-api' folder. 

Run the bundle command to install the gems for this project:

```bash
bundle install
```
## Usage
To display the frontend, cd into the 'js-frontend' folder and open it in your text editor.  

Then, copy and paste the full file path of index.html into the browser.

The full path should look something like this:

```
/Users/tiff/dev/jot-app/js-frontend/index.html
```
Start the rails server and refresh the page to get everything working:
```
rails s
```
